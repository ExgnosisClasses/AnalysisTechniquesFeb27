/*
This compliant solution assumes that the input from the file is at most 32 characters. 
Instead of inserting a null terminator, it constructs the std::string object based on 
the number of characters read from the input stream. If the size of the input is uncertain, 
it is better to use std::basic_istream<T>::readsome() or a formatted input function, depending on need.
