/*
This noncompliant code example improves the previous noncompliant code example by 
seeding the random number generation engine with the current time. However, this 
approach is still unsuitable when an attacker can control the time at which the seeding is 
executed. Predictable seed values can result in exploits when the subverted PRNG is used.
