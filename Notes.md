## Human Engineering

- bribery, theft of credentials, spoofing
  
## STRIDE

#### 1. Adversary Analysis

- Identify potential adversaries for category
  - What they would want to accomplish in an attack
  - What sort STRIDE would they be likely to do.

## Day 2

### Recap
- Threat modeling
- Secure coding
- Security
- DevSecOps

### Moving forward
- Policy and procedure - integrated security approach
- Specific attacks 
- "Secrets"
- Testing security from multiple perspectives
- Static analysis 
- Project defining a security program 
  - Personal security
  - IRS situations
  - 
## Defences

### Browsers
- Choice for security
- Choose other tools for security
- Choose secure extensions - do some research
  
### VPNs
- get a reputable
- gov't vpns 

### 2FA
- Something you know
- Somewhere you are
- Something you have

### Control Flow
- Static vulnerabilities are found by inspect - code is not executed
- Attackers attempt to put the system an unstable
- Program state
  - Instruction counter
  - stack - memory 
  - heap - memory
  - registers - highspeed computer
  
### Testing 
- control flow typically software
- black box
  - internally by people who are familiar with the app (IRS employees)
  - external testers - tiger team.

## Project

- personal = household
- 
# Phase 1 - assessment

1. Passwords - what is your practice? 
2. Virus scanner and malware detection
3. Are you vulnerable to attacks - clicking on links
4. Privacy
   1. Social media 
   2. trackings
   3. same email, opt of tracking
   4. browser extensions
   5. phone GPS or turn off or let yourself

   7. what do you upload to the cloud 
5. Where do install software from
6. Does everybody avoid 
  
7. Do you know what other family members do?

# Phase II policies
1. Policy that you follow regularly
   1. upated
   2. back up policy 
2. Password / credentials
   1. informed of possible breaches
   2. Rotate passwords
   3. Develop a strategy - not as good using tokens
   4. Try to "disposible passwords" 
   5. disposable emails and other creds
   6. dispsoable phone - registering phone.
   7. password manager
3. Regular review
   1. Purging accounts
   2. scanning with various tools
   3. Educate the family 
   4. Encryption - https-everywhere
   5. software up to date
4. habits
   1. don't click on links
   2. use spam filters
5. Firewalls are enabled and updated.

# Phase III: reset
1. Backup data
2. Reformat and reinstall operating
